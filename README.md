# GerstnerWaveHDRP

In this project, I followed some shader graph and gerstner waves tutorials in HDRP to learn how shader graphs and HDRP work. 
Here is a gif:

From this project I learned how to:

- Create shader graphs and use them.
- Implement Gerstner Wave function.
- Use and handle HDRP's HDRI Sky and HDRP's Fog.
